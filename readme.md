We present RFTrans, an RGB-D-based method for surface normal estimation and manipulation 
of transparent objects. By leveraging refractive flow as an intermediate representation, 
RFTrans circumvents the drawbacks of directly predicting the geometry (e.g. surface normal) 
from RGB images and helps bridge the sim-to-real gap.
